## main objective
We have to create a twitter bot that is similar to one that owen has already made before with one of his students (https://twitter.com/ks_ESG_daily).
Our bot is different because it will also comment on some of the ESG initiatives of companies under 網銀. We can also consider posting stuff about other 
companies, otherwise it might a bit to obvious that we are promoting 網銀 lol.

goals and grading criteria
- followers
- I guess content and process (i.e. our ability to create proper news updates). 


objective as on the slides (old)
we are exploring the use of AIGC technology to promote corporate ESG performance on social media platform Twitter. The success criteria for this 
project is to create noise, attract attention, and increase followers. The project is being carried out in collaboration with Wanin Group, one of 
leading software companies in Taiwan. You can choose one of the spin-off companies within their group as the promotion target.

## to-do
Step 1: get data
   - search wanin's website(s) for ESG updates
   - decide what KOLs and news agencies we are going to include in our daily scrapes. 
   - scraper? and API (crowdtangle)

step 2: find a way to filter and search our collected data
  - what are the hot topics of today?
  - SBERT, LLAMA, GPT? 
    - manually label titles?

step 3: post generation
  - decide on a framework for our posts
  - test different prompts
    - do research into prompt engineering
 
step 4: post
  - figure out how to make a bot post things automatically
