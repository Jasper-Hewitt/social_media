# social_media

main objective: 
we are exploring the use of AIGC technology to promote corporate ESG performance on social media platform Twitter. The success criteria for this 
project is to create noise, attract attention, and increase followers. The project is being carried out in collaboration with Wanin Group, one of 
leading software companies in Taiwan. You can choose one of the spin-off companies within their group as the promotion target.
